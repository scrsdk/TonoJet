This is the backend server for the Aviator Telegram Mini App.

## 📋 What This Does

- **Player connections** - Handles multiple players simultaneously  
- **Betting system** - Players can place bets and cash out
- **WebSocket communication** - Live updates to all players
- **Game loop** - Automated game rounds (betting → flying → crash → repeat)
